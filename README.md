There is also a magnet jar that you can place in the world and put a magnet inside to attract items to the jar.

Here is an example for what the magnet jar can be used for, now you don't need to collect all the eggs from the chickens.
The magnet jar automatically attracts all the items to itself (when a magnet with energy is inside) and the hopper below will pick it up.
